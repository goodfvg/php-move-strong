what's your biggest weakness 



my biggest weakness is the fact I'm not
yet very good at public speaking or
giving presentations to large groups of
people although my weakness will not
affect my ability to perform competently
as a software engineer if there are any
opportunities in your organization to
develop my public speaking skills then I
would like to give it a try that's a
brilliant answer you are giving a
weakness that will not affect your
ability to perform your duties as a
software engineer competently but you
are saying you do want to improve so if
there are any opportunities you would
like to give it a try and that shows
confidence and a willingness to learn
improve and develop which is important
in the role
