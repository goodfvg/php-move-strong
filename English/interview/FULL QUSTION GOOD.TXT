15 = How do you deal with problems / How do you approach problem-solving as a programmer? (code)

=> My technique in troubleshooting programming problems relies on a series of specific steps , which includes:

First , Problem Identification: First and foremost i start by looking for the cause of the problem in the source code

Second , Exclusion Testing : When I encounter difficulty in identifying the problem I remove the lines that are believed to be causing the issue , This action makes error hunting easier

Third ,Verification Testing : After removing the suspected lines, I restart the program to test whether the problem still exists or not. If the issue disappears, it indicates that the problem was related to the deleted lines

Fourth , Understanding the Error: Once the problem is identified, I begin to understand the root cause of this error. This understanding helps me avoid repeating the issue in the future and enhances my expertise

Fifth , Precise Solution: Building on my understanding of the problem, I work on crafting a precise and effective solution. This solution must be carefully designed without impacting the overall workflow of the code.

Finally , Thorough Testing and Review: After resolving the problem, I conduct extensive tests to verify that there are no other issues or negative impacts on the program due to the solution.

In this way, I contribute to maintaining code quality and ensuring that the correction of the problem doesn't adversely affect the program's performance


###########################################################################################

16 = how overcome the challenges

=> I have a proven track record of overcoming challenges throughout my career I have faced many challenges for example, at the beginning of my career I immediately jumped into creating complex websites  , in my first project I faced a problem where the code was not working even though all the lines were correct. This inspired me a lot, and it was difficult to identify the causes, but I followed my own methodology and used analytical thinking to search for the causes.I was able to identify the cause of the problem , It turned out to be caused by a conflict between the jQuery libraries used in the project. Thanks to critical thinking, I was able to solve the problem in a short period of time. I believe that this proves that I have a strong innate ability to follow a very strong methodology for searching for causes and easily revealing them. I believe that this style is constantly evolving with every new challenge
