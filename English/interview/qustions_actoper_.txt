2 - What are your biggest weaknesses  /  What are your weaknesses

=> My weakness is that I often have an excessive curiosity about how things work, to the point where I compel myself to research and learn more For example, I have a curiosity about how a specific function works However, when I find myself stumbling and unable to comprehend this function it can lead to feelings of distress and it forces my mind to keep thinking about finding an explanation I find myself uncomfortable until I can understand it So, I try to understand it repeatedly and I often end up wasting precious time in attempting to grasp it again However, at the present time, I am working on developing strategies to address this weakness For instance, I have started to postpone understanding complex matters to moments when I am calmer and more stable This helps me understand them better and faster In fact, I can now harness this strong curiosity to enhance my skills and continuously expand my knowledge. Additionally, this passion for understanding things means that I am always committed to self-improvement and growth in both my personal and professional life

6 - How do you deal with problems / How do you approach problem-solving as a programmer? (code)

=> Understanding and addressing problems are essential aspects of the programming work context. My technique in troubleshooting programming problems relies on a series of specific steps aimed at ensuring a thorough examination and an effective solution within a structured and systematic process, which includes:

Problem Identification: First and foremost, I begin by pinpointing the issue within the code. This initial step assists me in identifying the specific point that requires a deeper examination and correction.

Smart Deletion: If it's challenging to quickly pinpoint the problem, I employ smart deletion by removing lines believed to be causing the issue. This action simplifies the code and makes error hunting easier.

Location Testing: After deleting the suspicious lines, I restart the program and test the potential problem area. If the issue disappears, it indicates that the problem was related to the deleted lines.

Understanding the Error: Once I accurately identify the problem, I begin to understand the root cause of this error. This understanding helps me avoid repeating the problem in the future and enhances my expertise.

Precise Solution: Building on my understanding of the problem, I work on crafting a precise and effective solution. This solution must be carefully designed without impacting the overall workflow of the code.

Thorough Testing and Review: After resolving the problem, I conduct extensive tests to verify that there are no other issues or negative impacts on the program due to the solution.

In this way, I contribute to maintaining code quality and ensuring that the correction of the problem doesn't adversely affect the program's performance

9 - How do you handle conflict with others?
=> I believe that conflict is a natural part of the workplace, and I am confident in my ability to handle conflict in a professional manner. My approach to resolving conflicts involves attempting to understand the other person's perspective first. I do this by actively listening and asking clarifying questions. Through asking questions, we can understand the negative and positive consequences of various solutions and think about a solution that suits both parties. When we agree on a solution, it is important for us to create a feasibility study for that solution to ensure that it is a reliable solution that serves the purpose. We must also consider that the solution does not have a negative impact on the company. If we are not sure about the quality of the solution, we will seek advice from experienced team members. I am prepared to make concessions and find a suitable solution. It is important to encourage team members to propose solutions, which gives us a variety of solutions that may benefit us in the future


أعتقد أن الصراع هو جزء طبيعي من مكان العمل، وأنا واثق من قدرتي على التعامل مع الصراع بطريقة مهنية وبناءة على أسلوبي في حل النزاعات هو محاولة فهم وجهة نظر الشخص الآخر أولاً. أفعل ذلك من خلال الاستماع بنشاط وطرح الأسئلة التوضيحية  من خلال طرح الاسئله يمكننا ان نفهم العواقب السلبيه والايجابيه لكل الحلول والتفكير في حل يناسب الطرفين وعندما نتفق على حل يجب علينا انشاء دراسه جدوئ لهذا الحل للتأكد انه حل موثوق ويخدم الغرض وعلينا ان نضع في اعتبارنا  ينبغي للحل لايؤثر على الشركه او اداة الفريق  اذا لم نكن متأكدين من جوده الحل فسوف نستفسر من احد كبار الفريق  ذو خبره  وانا على استعداد لتقديم تنازلات وإيجاد حل يناسب جميع المعنيين ومن المهم جعل اعضا الفريق يطرحون الحلول مما يمنحنا حلول منوعه قد تساهم بتوفير حلول لنا تفيدنا في المستقبل
