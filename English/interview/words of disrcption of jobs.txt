While you can use if conditionals to check for potential errors and handle them accordingly, using exceptions is generally considered a better practice for several reasons:

Clarity and Readability: Using exceptions makes the code more explicit about the potential for errors and how they are handled. The try-catch block clearly separates the normal program logic from the error handling logic, making the code easier to read and understand.

Modularity and Reusability: Exceptions promote modularity by encapsulating error handling logic within distinct blocks. This makes it easier to reuse code in different parts of a program and across different projects.

Encapsulation and Abstraction: Exceptions allow developers to abstract away the details of error handling, focusing on the core functionality of the code. This can make the code more maintainable and less prone to errors.

Propagation and Unforeseen Errors: Exceptions can propagate up the call stack, allowing error handling to be centrally managed and ensuring that unforeseen errors are not ignored.

Graceful Recovery and User Experience: Exceptions provide a mechanism for graceful recovery from errors, preventing program crashes and allowing developers to provide meaningful feedback to users.

In summary, while if conditionals can be used for basic error checking, exceptions offer a more structured, robust, and maintainable approach to error handling in programming. The benefits of using exceptions outweigh the occasional convenience of if conditionals, especially in complex and large-scale projects.
